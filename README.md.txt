First Commit for my ProcGen Card Game about Insurance Draft. 

The goal of the game is to place individuals in "buckets" based on their percieved risk factors surrounding auto insurance.
In this case you would be the insurance company. If you miscalculate and place someone that is low risk in a high risk you will lose them
as a customer. If you place high risk individuals in a low risk bucket they will inevitably get in an accident and you will need to pay out,
these both could mean that your company goes bankrupt if you do them too often.

The game should end naturally after enough "cycles" totalling 5-10 minutes with either a profitable or bankrupt company

payouts: 
low +50/month
moderate  +100/month
high +250/month
accident -500

Working:
Cards are procedurally generated with working values using a prefab and randGen

Needs Implementation:
Scoring
Moving Cards to buckets effectively
Endgame

Broken:
UI Scale
Card Placement is often overlapped or off screen(These Two could be related)
